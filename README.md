# 📘 Basic Python Programs – Practice Collection

This is a collection of basic Python programs I wrote as part of my **programming practice**. Each program focuses on solving a commonly asked beginner-level problem. Writing these helped me get more comfortable with logic-building and syntax in Python.

## 🧠 What’s Included

1. **🔁 Repeated Element Check**  
   Checks whether a list contains any repeated elements.

2. **🧮 Factorial Calculation**  
   Calculates the factorial of a given number using loop or recursion.

3. **➕ Matrix Addition**  
   Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.

4. **📈 Max Profit in Share Market**  
   Given a list of stock prices over a week, finds the maximum possible profit by choosing a single buy and sell day.

5. **📉 Descending Sort**  
   Sorts a list or array in descending order.

6. **🔢 Sum of Two Highest Numbers**  
   Finds the two largest numbers in a list and returns their sum.

## 📚 Purpose

This is not a polished project but a **practice set** I used to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts like:

- Loops & conditionals  
- Arrays/lists  
- Basic algorithms  
- Function design
